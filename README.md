# odin-recipes
First project of The Odin Project foundations course

This is a basic practical way of practising the various HTML lessons I've gone over so far.
Ideally I will be using git to maintain the repository with well written atomic commits, as well as create a base directory filled with what I can only assume is recipes as well as other .html files to create the most barebones of a barebones website.
